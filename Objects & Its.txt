Objects & Its Internal Representation in Js

	Object is the most important datatype in js. eventhough it is a datatype ,it differs from other datatype.
other datatype like Number,boolean ,string...etc, can store one value at a time but object in js, can store more than one value,and
also it can store datatype variables.
we may conclude that object is unordered collection of related data

 for example

	var student={name:"noor",Batch:52};
here student is object , it contains a string and Number

Object in js, associate with properties that defines the object in above example name & batch is the properties of object student
it defined as "key:value" pair; where key can a variable or function;
we can access any of the properties of object by "."notion

	objectName.objectProperty;
	
	console.log(student.name); //noor;
we can add more properties ,delete properties ,use this properties to any other object if it is needed

Declaration of Object 
	
	1. Object with object literals;
		
		var objectName={key1:value1,key2:value};
	
		it is the simplest method create an object in js.
 
	2. Object Using Constructor Function
		
		constructor Function allows to creat Multiple object with same set of properties with differren value using "new" keyword;
	
		for ex:
		
		function Bike(name,model){
		this.name=name;
		this.model=model;
			}
		let bike1= new Bike("hero", 2011);
		let bike2= new Bike( "FZ",2015);

		here constuctor function Bike allows the Objects (bike1 &bike2), access itself;
	
	3. Object with new keyword
		
		var objName= new Object(); in this way can create object and we can add properties to it;

		objName.objProperties=value;
		
		for ex:

			var emp= new Object();
			emp.name="noor";	
			emp.designation="XXXX";
			emp.salary=000000;
		like that we can add more properties;

	4. Object using create method
		
		In this method , we can use one object as template  to other object 

		let food={ type:"non-veg", display: function()
			{	
				console.log(this.type);
				}
		let mocktail =Object.create(food);
		mocktail.type="drinks";
		moctail.display();
